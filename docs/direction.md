# Product direction for Polygive

## Description
Polygive is an as-of-yet unfounded non-profit which will provide a 2-sided platform for giving and receiving donations.

## Vision
The goal of Polygive is to increase the total amount that people donate by enabling donors to give, rather than enabling fundraisers to find donors. As an organization, Polygive believes that making donation convenient and easy for the donors will have a dramatic positive impact on the who donates, the amount donors give, and the diversity of causes that donors give to.

Identified are few core principles that will help to guide decision making and refine Polygive’s direction in tackling the aforementioned goals:

Polygive should provide the best platform for first time donors. As growing the total donor pool is likely the strongest mechanism by which Polygive grows the amount donors give overall, Polygive should both provide a best-in-class experience for people who have decided to become donors, as well as convert people who were hesitant to give in the past into first-time donors.

Polygive should make donors confident they are donating their money to what they personally believe in. Users should both feel and believe that donating their money through Polygive is a method by which they can effect change for the causes that are important to them.

Polygive should give the donor a sense of trust that the charities respect the donor’s money. Users should feel confident that if a charity starts misusing donations, they will learn about the misuse and be able to respond appropriately.

## Product
The product consists of 3 main pieces:
- A donors portal
- A directory containing all fundraisers and charities on the platform
- A fundraisers portal

As the focus of the platform is building engagement with the donors through a centralized platform, the donors portal will constitute the bulk of the work and receive the most product and business focus.

### Donors Portal
The donors portal is accessed through the front page and is featured prominently on the site, as to give the user the impression that this is the primary usage of the site. When accessed, the donors portal consists of several components:

A dashboard, detailing both one-time, monthly, and yearly donations to established charities of the donor’s choice. This page will consist of a few graphs showing the relative industries and impact that the donor has on the causes they specifically care about.
A view to sort through the directory of charities and fundraisers, such that they can discover new causes to give towards, sorted by reputability, locality, and impact.

### Directory
The directory is a list of all fundraisers and charities that donors can donate to. The directory is initially populated internally to Polygive, such that Polygive can control the quality and number of fundraisers on the platform. Additionally, this has the added benefit of not requiring that Polygive partner with charities to form an initial set of charities.

When Polygive is well established, the directory will primarily be populated by charities applying through the fundraisers portal. In order to maintain the quality of charities and fundraisers on the platform, these charities will be vetted in the same way.

Since fundraisers want to control their brand and connect with their donors in meaningful ways, it is imperative that a fundraiser be able to take control of their entry in the directory, edit their externally-facing messaging, and view all related information, including basic donor information of those who have chosen not to donate anonymously and the amount that they donate.

### Fundraisers Portal
Fundraisers can request access to the fundraisers portal via two mechanisms:
- A mechanism by which a fundraiser can claim a currently existing entry in the directory.
- A mechanism by which a new fundraiser can submit an application to be admitted to the registry (pending verification that they are indeed a legitimate nonprofit).

The portal for fundraisers consists of several pieces:
- A dashboard in which they can view the donors that have not opted out from anonymous to their platform.
- A profile edit page in which they can edit their publicly and privately visible information. 
- A mechanism by which they can post publicly visible announcements and updates relating to their charity. These messages are displayed within the directory and are also sent as emails in either individual or digest format, depending on user preferences.

## Competitors
While there are several competitors, most of them focus on providing good tools for fundraisers, whereas few seem to focus on providing a good experience for the donors.  The primary competitor in this space would be Network for Good. Network for Good offers tools for both fundraisers and for donors by providing both a portal for donors and fundraisers. However, as far as I can tell, their tools for donors do not span multiple subdomains and charities.
